## Introduction
Here is a part of an application that creates a file tree data structure from JSON input. However, there are one or more bugs in this code. It seems that for some data sets this code creates an incorrect tree structure.

Another developer was able to isolate the bug and wrote a test case that simulates the bug. See src/app.spec.js for test case details. You can build the project to see which tests are failing.

## Problem Statement
Your job is to find the bug and fix it. The only file that should be changed is src/app.js. You can always run tests in the project to see if your solution works.

## Setup
Follow these steps:

`npm install` – install dependencies

`npm test` – run all tests (this will be used to evaluate your solutions)

`npm run test:watch` – run all tests in watch mode (alternative to npm test which you might find more convenient to use locally)

`nvm install` - (optional) set up the expected major version of Node.js locally (nvm required; Node.js version defined in .nvmrc file)

Good Luck!

## Solution

Please, send us only the `src/app.js` file with the solution.
